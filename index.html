        Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to the buildup of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere — primarily from human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes.

🔹 Key Causes of Global Warming

Burning Fossil Fuels

Coal, oil, and natural gas release carbon dioxide (CO₂).

Deforestation

Fewer trees mean less CO₂ is absorbed from the atmosphere.

Agriculture & Livestock

Releases methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O).

Industrial Processes

        The Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. It’s about 4.5 billion years old, and it's home to millions of species — including humans. Earth provides the perfect conditions for life: a breathable atmosphere, liquid water, and a suitable climate.

🌍 Quick Facts About Earth:

Shape: Oblate spheroid (slightly flattened at the poles)

Surface: ~71% water, ~29% land

Atmosphere: Mostly nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%)

Diameter: ~12,742 km (7,918 miles)

Moon: 1 natural satellite — the Moon

Orbit: Takes ~365.25 days to orbit the Sun

Rotation: 1 rotation = 24 hours (causes day and night)

🌎 Earth's Layers:

Crust – the outer layer (where we live)

Mantle – hot, semi-solid rock

Outer Core – liquid iron and nickel

Inner Core – solid iron and nickel

🌱 Why Earth is Special:

Supports life (thanks to liquid water, moderate temperatures, and oxygen)

Magnetic field protects from solar radiation

Ozone layer shields from harmful UV rays

🌡️ Environmental Concerns:

Global warming

Pollution

Deforestation

Loss of biodiversity

🛡️ How We Can Protect Earth:

Recycle and reduce waste

Use clean energy

Conserve water and electricity

Plant trees and protect forests

Educate others about sustainability
